Evapotranspiration is the vital component of hydrologic cycle (Dar et al., 2017; Tahashildar et al., 2017; Latief et al., 2017). Its precise estimation is of key importance for studying hydrologic water balance, design of irrigation systems and crop yield simulation.Various methods and equations are already employed to measure and monitor the evapotranspiration, but owing to difficulty in getting precise evapotranspiration measurement directly, it is generally estimated from locallyor globally available meteorological data with the help of multiple models. Numerous studies have been conducted to compare and evaluate the
performance of different models, till date (Caprio 1974; Irmak et al., 2003; Tabari et al., 2013; McGuinness et al., 1972). Each model has its own pros and cons that make it different from other and suitable for particular type of scenario.

The proposed study is performed in the Department of Computer Application laboratory, situated at Gangtok  (27.3389° N, 88.6065° E), the capital of the north-eastern hill state Sikkim, during the month of September 2017. This case study may be apprehended as a proof-of-concept to the fact that the Internet of Things (IoT) is well capable to uplift the process of computation of various models in more ease,  efficient and cost-effective way.The objective of this study 
is to validate the aspects of completely autonomic computation of the sun radiative models through advanced ICT tools such as the Internet of Things (IoT).
